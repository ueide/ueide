## Hi there👋 
### UX/UI Designer & Software Engineer

I bridge the gap between complex technical logic and intuitive user experiences. With 5 years of experience in UX/UI Design and a strong foundation in Software Engineering, I build products that are as robust under the hood as they are beautiful on the surface.

*"I don't just write code; I design how the world interacts with it."*


- 🎨 **Design Thinking:** User research, wireframing, and interactive prototyping.
- 💻 **Engineering:** C++, Node.js, and high-performance creative coding (p5.js).

Here's a quick peek at the languages, frameworks, and tools I am comfortable with for creating modern, responsive applications that really connect with users!
